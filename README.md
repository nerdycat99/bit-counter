# README FOR BIT COUNTER

download/clone locally
in terminal go to folder where file bit_counter.rb exists
run "irb -r ./bit_counter.rb"
use command count_bits "folder/file.ext" to return the total number of bits and how many zero and one bits the file contains


a test image (cages.jpg) is included in sub folder 'image', so to analyse this image in IRB run count_bits "image/cages.jpg"
